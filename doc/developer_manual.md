HTML: So HTML is the file where we have most of our structure. Here we are able to display some of the other pieces of information that were divided up amongst the other files. The index.html file is where most of the connecting will be made in regards to linking to the other pages we have made. Be sure to connect the pages to their appropiate ID/file name. 

CSS:CSS has its own file and is used for styling purposes.The main purpose of this file is to style the menu bar and overall look of the website. Be sure that the appropiate ID has the adjustments you intend to have. In the HTML file be sure to reference the CSS file in the header. Most of the styling was done in-line since each some pages were split for each person to work on. We used w3 style sheets.


JS: Javscript was used to structure some of our layout in the HTML files.  Be sure to appropiately reference the file in your index.html. Libararies that were used are angular.js and leaflet api. For angular.js the page that uses it is index2.html and leaflet was map.html

PHP: The PHP code written found within getData.php it serves as a way to directly connect to our database. The PHP allows for the user to grab some of the database through various commands. These lines of code can be found in the html file dealing with catalog. Be sure to adjust the connect information with your local machine. This involves the name of your localhost, username, password, and appropiately referencing the database name included.

Database: The database consists of two tables, which are then connect through a similar key, being time_id. This serves the purpose of being able to show some of the other information from the other table when calling for the first table after using a JOIN. This allows for the tables to not have all of the information in one and allows for some flexibilty when it comes to what is being displayed.
